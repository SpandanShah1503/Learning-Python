# Learning-Python

Hey! This is my personal repository where Iâ€™m learning Python from scratch.  
I'll be uploading everything I learn â€” step by step â€” from basic to advanced.

Each day, Iâ€™ll post:
- Code examples
- Practice exercises
- Notes (sometimes)

This repo is just a way for me to stay consistent and track my Python journey.  
Feel free to check out the folders if youâ€™re learning too!

Stay tuned for daily updates ðŸš€
